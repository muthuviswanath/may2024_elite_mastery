Reflection:

		It provides the ability to inspect and modify the runtime behavior of the application.
		Class is an inbuilt class in java using which we inspect the interface,enums,get their
		structures,methods,fields, construcotrs,etc.....
		Using reflection we can create objects (without using new keyword)
		
		Junit -> uses reflection to parse @Test annotation to get the test methods and invoke them when needed
		Spring -> DI
		Tomcat -> Web container that is used to forward  the request to the module using web.xml
